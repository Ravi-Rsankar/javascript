### Some basics

##### Dot and bracket notation

Both notations are used to update the properties in an object.

Bracket notation is required if your property has a space in it or if you want to use a variable to name the property.

In Dot notation property cannot start with a number and it cannot have variables as a property. The property used in the dot notation has to be a property of the object and not a variable

*Use the Dot Notation. But if youâ€™re dealing with invalid identifier or variables, use the Bracket notation.*:thumbsup:
